# Doxyfile 1.8.20

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Sample"

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C sources
# only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C. For
# instance, some of the names that are used will be different. The list of all
# members will be omitted, etc.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = YES

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.

RECURSIVE              = YES

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO

# If the GENERATE_XML tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate an XML file that
# captures the structure of the code including all documentation.

GENERATE_XML           = YES
