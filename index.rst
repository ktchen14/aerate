Vector Access
-------------

The functions in this section are used to access elements in a vector. Most of
the time they're unnecessary as it's easier to use the normal pointer semantics
of a vector to access elements.

.. autoctype:: vector_c

.. autocstruct:: __vector_header_t

.. autocfunction:: vector_at

.. autocfunction:: vector_index
